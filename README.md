# UnicodeInput
A Simple Windows background program to write unicode characters like emojis. 
Usable as macro system for programmable keyboards without a paste functionality (like my Corsair K95 😅)

## Usage
`ctrl + alt + NumPad: < Unicode Codepoint in HEX > `
On key release, the unicode symbol will be placed where your current input focus lies.

### Examples

`ctrl + alt + (1) + (F) + (6) + (0) + (2)` => 😂 (U+1F602)

`ctrl + alt + (2) + (7) + (6) + (4)`=> ❤  (U+2764)
## Contribution
Please report any bugs and share your ideas to improve this tiny program further 😊
