# UnicodeInput
A Simple Windows background program to write unicode characters like emojis. 
Usable as macro system for programmable keyboards without a paste functionality (like my Corsair K95 üòÖ)
## Why?
On windows, you can't really type Unicode characters that aren't directly linked to keys on your keyboard. With Alt + Numpad you get some symbols, but not a whole lot, and even with the Registry Modification to enable the Hex NumPad, you're still limited to 4 hex digits, so everything past U+FFFF is off limits. But if I want to macro emojis for usage in Whatsapp Web or the standalone version, I'm screwed. So that's why I wrote this little tool.

## Usage
`ctrl + alt + NumPad: < Unicode Codepoint in HEX > `
On key release, the unicode symbol will be placed where your current input focus lies.

### Examples

`ctrl + alt + (1) + (F) + (6) + (0) + (2)` => üòÇ (U+1F602)

`ctrl + alt + (2) + (7) + (6) + (4)`=> ‚ù§  (U+2764)
